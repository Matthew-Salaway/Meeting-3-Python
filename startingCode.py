# We have some important information about officers, so lets talk about it now

# Lets review last weeks concepts with a game of MadLibs. We want to ask the user for two pieces of information and transform it into a story. First make two variables and ask the user for input to store personalized user data into the variables.
# Then, with sring concatenation, make a story out of the user input. Feel free to make your own story, or follow this example.

# Create the variable typeOfPet and store user input. Create the variable nameOfPet and store user input. Then, using string concatenation, create the variable story as: I just bought a (typeOfPet) and named it (nameOfPet). Print story





# Now lets learn functions!
# A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function. A function can return data as a result.

# Functions are useful for code that needs to be repeated. Lets make a function that is called yearsTillOneHundred. The parameter will be the age, and the function will print how many years until the person is 100 and then return the variable. Try it!
# Need a challenge? Use if/else statments in case the age is 100, below 0 or over 100.




# Lets create a function that calls on another function! How about a greeing, followed by how many more years until 100. Name the funtion greetingCard. Call the say hello function, and then the yearsTillOneHundred function.
